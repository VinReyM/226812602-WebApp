    <h1>CSS Basic Styling</h1>
    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
    <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
    <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
    <p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> h1 This is a heading /h1</li>
        <li>p This is a paragraph p</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development for large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
    <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS</p>
    <p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
